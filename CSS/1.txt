 4. CSS Units
CSS units define how sizes (like width, height, margins, and padding) are measured in a web page. They are mainly categorized into absolute and relative units.

1. Absolute Units
Absolute units remain the same regardless of screen size or resolution. These units are best suited for print design.
px is commonly used for web design 

2.Relative units
They adapt to the surrounding elements, making them more responsive.

em-	Relative to the font-size of the parent	1em = parent font-size
rem-	Relative to the root <html> font-size	1rem = root font-size
%-	Percentage of the parent element	50% = half of the parent size
vh-	Viewport height	1vh = 1% of viewport height
vw-	Viewport width	1vw = 1% of viewport width
vmin-	Smaller of vh or vw	Responsive to screen size
vmax-	Larger of vh or vw	Responsive to screen size

p {
  font-size: 2em; (Twice the parent's font size )
}

.container {
  width: 50vw; (50% of viewport width ) 
}
